In a small bush behind the third crab apple tree on the left, was the house of a small gnome boy named Skizzle. Skizzle was strange, Skizzle at close range was, to put it lightly, quite deranged. Despite his uncanny quirks, Skizzle had one large heroic trait. A trait that would make anyone state, I hate to say it, but that trait sure does sedate.

Although he was odd, all the other gnomes loved Skizzel for this trait. They shouted his name with joy when he passed by. Skizzel was the kindest gnome in the village.

One day, storming into the forest, came a dragon larger than any measure. It bellowed and screeched "gimme all that treasure!" All the other gnomes screamed and began to run, except for Skizzle, who said "you won't hurt anyone".

Skizzle leaped toward the beast, and being exceedingly nimble, challenged the great dragon to a dance-off on a thimble. No treasure-loving dragon would ever turn down such a feat, "But I dance first!" the dragon roared, while Skizzle laid down a beat.


Skizzle thought his beat woud cause deceit, however it only made the dragon move his feet. After his dance the dragon procliamed "Ha boy that beat was critically acclaimed". "Thanks man, Ive been working on it all day" said Skizzle, "Hey do you want to quit this music jazz and just be friends?". "Sure", said the dragon.
